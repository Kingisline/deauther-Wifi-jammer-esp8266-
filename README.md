## About this Project

This firmware allows you to easily perform a variety of actions to test 802.11 networks using an [EPS8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266) . It's also a great project for learning about WiFi, microcontrollers, Arduino, hacking and electronics/programming in general.

The deauthentication attack is the main feature, which can be used to disconnect devices from their WiFi network.
Although this denial-of-service attack is nothing new, a lot of devices are still vulnerable to it. Luckily this is slowly changing with more WiFi 6 enabled devices being used. But a lot of outdated WiFi devices remain in place, for example in cheap IoT hardware. With an ESP8266 Deauther, you can easily test this attack on your 2.4GHz WiFi network/devices and see whether it's successful or not. And if it is, you know you should upgrade your network.
